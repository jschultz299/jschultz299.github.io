    <em>I am actively looking for exciting opportunities in robotics and machine learning!</em>
</p>

<p>
    Hi! My name is Jack Schultz. I am currently working toward earning my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at 
    <a href="https://www.csuohio.edu/">Cleveland State University</a>. I plan to graduate in <strong>May 2023</strong>. 
    I have strong interests in robotics, mechatronics, controls, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. My long term 
    goal is to develop transformative technologies in the fields of robotics and machine learning which transition society 
    to a world of abundance and empower humans to live productive and healthy lives.
</p> 
    
<p>
    The group I am currently a part of is the <a href="http://chms.csuohio.edu/">Center for Human Machine Systems</a>.  
    My current research project combines robotics, computer vision, and eye tracking 
    to enable individuals with spinal cord injuries to feed themselves. You can find information regarding this work and 
    more on the <a href="http://jschultz299.github.io/projects/">Projects</a> page.
</p>

<p>
    Project topics include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>robot manipulation</strong></li>
  <li><strong>motion planning</strong></li>
  <li><strong>computer vision</strong></li>
  <li><strong>natural language processing</strong></li>
  <li><strong>assistive device development</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Skills developed include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Python</strong></li>
  <li><strong>ROS</strong></li>
  <li><strong>C++</strong></li>
  <li><strong>QML</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Fabrication</strong></li>
</ul>

    If you're interested in learning a little bit more about me, keep reading! I'm originally from St. Louis, Missouri.
    I moved to Ohio in 2013 and earned my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University 
    of Dayton in December 2017. I then moved to Cleveland, Ohio the following summer where I entered into my current role, 
    working toward earning my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Cleveland State University. Although I've been in Ohio 
    for almost a decade, I still remain a huge Cardinals and Blues fan! I've slowly been converted into a Browns 
    fan as well, which has taught me a lot about my pain tolerance <font face="Segoe UI Symbol">&#128541;</font>.

<p>
    I love playing sports such as broomball, lacrosse, golf, and spikeball, as well as other outdoor 
    activities including snowboarding, wakeboarding, hiking, and traveling. I also play electric guitar and enjoy 
    all the classic rock bands, especially Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Jimi Hendrix, and Van Halen.

    My real passion, however, is learning. I love building things that combine both technology and creativity, learning 
    about new research ideas and fabrication techniques along the way. Whether it's casting aluminum 
    parts in a homeade foundry, tearing down and rebuilding an old dirtbike, or converting a gaming console into a 
    portable system, there is something to be learned from every experience. Check out some of these fun projects on the 
    <a href="http://jschultz299.github.io/projects/">Projects</a> page!
