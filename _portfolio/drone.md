    <p>
        Back in 2016, every kid wanted to build a drone, and I was no exeption. I wanted to learn how to 3D print, however, so I combined the two interests and set out to build a quadcopter with a 3D printed frame.
    </p>

    <p>
        The primary components you need for a quadcopter are:
        <ul>
            <li>A frame</li>
            <li>Battery</li>
            <li>Power Distribution Board (PDB)</li>
            <li>Motors</li>
            <li>Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC)</li>
            <li>Propellors</li>
            <li>Radio and Receiver</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        More coming soon...
