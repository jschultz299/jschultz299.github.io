According to the World Health Organization, there are more than 1 billion people, or 15% of the worldâ€™s population, living with some sort of a motor impairment[^1]. One of the most highly rated ADLs by people with movement disorders is the ability to prepare a meal and feed oneself[^2]. 

The goal of this project was to design, develop, prototype, test, and evaluate a robotic device that enables people with high-level spinal cord injuries to feed themselves with minimal command inputs.

More details coming soon, but for now, check out this video demonstrating the initial prototype of the system.
